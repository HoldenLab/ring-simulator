# ring-simulator
 ring simulation
%%%INFORMATION %%%
MATLAB software for simulation of vertically immobilized bacteria using VerCINI (Vertical Cell Imaging by Nanostructured Immobilization). Associated with Whitley et al, bioRxiv 2020.
This code is provided as is and without warranty to support reproducibility and open science. It is in-house code, minimally documented, warts and all. 

This simulator is primarily made available for reproducibility purposes, however it may also be adaptable for other simulations of dynamics of circumferentially organized filaments.

To reproduce Whitley 2020 simulations, add ring-simulator folder to MATLAB path, and run nascent_zdynamic_sim.m to generate simulations corresponding to Supplementary Figure 20 data.

 .\testing is lots of internal tests to confirm validity of simulator
